# Coffee Drop API
This task requires you to build a JSON API. HTML, CSS and Javascript work will be reviewed but is entirely optional.
 
## Brief
A brand new start up, CoffeeDrop, have spotted a gap in the market to build an Android and IOS mobile app which shows their existing 16 national coffee shops, listing them as "locations" for recycling Nespresso coffee pods, for which the client will recieve "cashback" - money for each pod.
After initial meetings with CoffeeDrop, they have asked us to develop a small API which allows a customer using their mobile app to enter their postcode, and be informed of their nearest (as the crow flies) CoffeeDrop location and their opening times.
The API must also allow CoffeeDrop to add a new recycling center, as well as calculate for the user of the app the total amount of "cashback" they will recieve according to an algorithm listed below.
 
### Endpoints Required
 1. Accepts a postcode, returns the address and opening times of the closest CoffeeDrop Location
 2. Accepts a postcode, creates a new location which will then show up in the results of endpoint 1
 3. Accepts a quantity of each of the three szies of used coffee pods as raw post data in the format 
 {
	"Ristretto":10,
	"Espresso":100,
  "Lungo":30
  }
  and returns the amount in pounds and pence that the client will recieve in cashback according to the following rules:
  
  The first 50 capsules: [Ristretto = 2p, Espresso = 4p, Lungo = 6p]
  Capsules 50-500: [Ristetto = 3p, Espresso = 6p Lungo = 9p]
  Capsules 501+: [Ristretto = 5p, Espresso = 10p, Lungo = 15p]
